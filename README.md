# SuecaStars
This project revolves around creating a minigame using *Python* to simulate a popular card game in Portugal, called **Sueca**. As it stands, this script is only the gameplay of the card game and, **therefore, it is not the final version (nor the final goal) of this project.**



### You can find more about **Sueca** here:

 - [Sueca (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sueca_(card_game))

### Version 1.1 

- Fixed partners name chaning mid-game (thanks [Hugo Nogueira (@HugoNogueira05)](https://www.github.com/HugoNogueira05))

### Version 1.0 (First Release)

- Added shuffled decks
- Added shuffled names
- Ensured Sueca rules/mechanics
